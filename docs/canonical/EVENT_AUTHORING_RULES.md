# Event Authoring Rules

Every life event must support:
- Manual completion: user can act without automation.
- Assisted completion: scripts, resources, or autopilot drafts.
- Export: bundle outputs for offline use.

If automation is not possible:
- Explain why, propose the next-best human action, and keep the step actionable.

Guardrails:
- Culturally neutral, location-aware content. Include “verify locally” where relevant.
- Scales across income contexts; never assume paid services are available.
- No free-form tasks; each task declares why, urgency, how Fayvrz helps, and a fallback.

Authoring checklist:
- [ ] Task has purpose, urgency, and fallback.
- [ ] Each recommendation has a path to action.
- [ ] Exports available (script/checklist/resource bundle).
- [ ] Reduced-motion and accessibility respected in UI.
- [ ] Tested with Stripe disabled and AI disabled.
