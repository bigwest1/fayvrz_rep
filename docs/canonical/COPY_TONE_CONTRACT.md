# Copy Tone Contract

Tone:
- Brief, calm, capable.
- Human, direct, never chatty.
- Never patronizing or robotic.

Allowed phrasing:
- “Here’s what to do next.”
- “Verify details locally before acting.”
- “We’ll handle the draft; you decide.”
- “Ready when you are.”

Disallowed phrasing:
- “Cheer up! You got this!” (patronizing)
- “Apologies for the inconvenience...” (corporate filler)
- “As an AI, I think...” (robotic)
- “Just breathe, everything will be fine.” (therapy/psych framing)

Errors:
- Brief, own the issue, offer a path: “Something slipped. Try again or head home.”

Upsell copy:
- Calm and optional: “You’ve reached this limit. Upgrade to keep going.” One CTA, one “Not now.”

Sensitive events (loss, illness, crisis):
- Do: “We’ll keep this steady. Here’s the practical next step.”
- Don’t: “We’re sorry for your loss” (avoid therapy framing).
