## Fayvrz UX Principles

1) Calm clarity over buzz: short sentences, zero fluff.
2) Show value first: example plans before asking for input.
3) Action in reach: primary CTA visible on every card.
4) Verify-first: external info always marked “verify details”.
5) Safe defaults: reduced motion honored; focus states clear.
6) Warm neutrality: no gradients, off-whites and deep neutrals.
7) Shared ownership: “we handle / you handle” split where relevant.
8) Predictable pacing: small, quick motions; nothing blocking interaction.

### Tone rules
- Brief, calm, capable. No therapy or hype.
- Use verbs that suggest agency: “Review”, “Generate”, “Save”.

### No-gradient rule
- Solid backgrounds only. Depth via borders/shadows, not gloss.

### Motion rules
- Use Framer Motion only. Duration short (120–200ms), easing gentle.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; provide static fallbacks.
- Never gate interaction on animation completion.

### Confidence cues checklist
- Show why a task matters in one line.
- Display status and last action visibly.
- Provide “verify details” note on any external resource.
- Show what we handle vs what the user handles.
- Offer a quick “copy” or “generate” action per surface.
